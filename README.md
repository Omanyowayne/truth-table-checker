# Logic Model checker

**A Python implementation of propositional logic with model checking to evaluate logical sentences and test entailment.**

---

## ✨ Features

* Define logical sentences using:

  * **Symbol** (atomic propositions)
  * **Not** (negation)
  * **And** (conjunction)
  * **Or** (disjunction)
  * **Implication** (if–then)
  * **Biconditional** (if and only if)
* Evaluate sentences against a **model** (truth assignments).
* Perform **entailment checking** using truth table enumeration.
* Automatically extract all symbols in a logical expression.
* Pretty-print formulas with logical operators (`¬`, `∧`, `∨`, `=>`, `<=>`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/logic-model-checker.git
cd logic-model-checker
```

### 2. Run with Python

This project requires **Python 3.7+**.
You can test it directly in the Python REPL or create your own script.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Defining Symbols

```python
from logic import Symbol, Not, And, Or, Implication, Biconditional, model_check

# Define propositional symbols
P = Symbol("P")
Q = Symbol("Q")
```

### Example 2: Creating Sentences

```python
# Logical sentence: (P ∧ Q)
sentence = And(P, Q)
print(sentence.formula())   # Output: (P) ∧ (Q)
```

### Example 3: Evaluating with a Model

```python
# Model: P = True, Q = False
model = {"P": True, "Q": False}

print(sentence.evaluate(model))  # Output: False
```

### Example 4: Model Checking (Entailment)

```python
# Knowledge base: P => Q
knowledge = Implication(P, Q)

# Query: ¬P ∨ Q
query = Or(Not(P), Q)

# Check if KB entails query
print(model_check(knowledge, query))  # Output: True
```

## How It Works

The **model checker** works by:

1. Collecting all symbols in the knowledge base and query.
2. Enumerating all possible truth assignments (models).
3. Ensuring that **if the knowledge base is true in a model, the query is also true** in that model.
4. Returning `True` if the query is entailed, otherwise `False`.

---

## Example Use Cases

* Learning **propositional logic** and **truth tables**.
* Practicing **knowledge representation** (AI/logic courses).
* Building a base for **AI reasoning systems**.

---

## Future Improvements

* Support multiple sentences in the knowledge base.
* Implement **resolution-based inference**.
* Add a simple **command-line interface (CLI)** for interactive use.
